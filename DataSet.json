    "Cats":{"title":"Cats", "description":"Cats, like human, are individuals. Each is unique, each has a unique personality. I have known cats I did not like at all, and can say the same about humans. However, I would trust the average cat a great deal more than I would trust the average human. Cats are real. They don’t lie, they don’t pretend to be something they are not. Cats repay respect with respect. Cats are my kind of people.", "image": "cats.jpg"},
    "Travel":{"title":"Travel", "description":"Our lives are time-starved and technology-driven and, let’s be honest, it’s not often that we actually take the necessary time to de-stress and truly switch off. Travel allows us to escape life’s daily demands, dramas and deadlines and enables us to clear our minds. It encourages us to recharge our batteries and to truly disconnect from our phones, Wi-Fi, emails, laptops, social media, in order to reconnect with ourselves, each other and the natural environment.", "image": "travel.jpg"}
